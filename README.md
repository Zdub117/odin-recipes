HMTL Recipe Book Testing

During this project I am going to be creating a basic recipe website to hone mt HTML skills.

My goals for the project are to practice the following:
1) Creating a main page that serves as a appendix/homebase for my recipe book.
2) Create various other pages that will house different recipes. (Maybe do 4 recipes total?)
3) Link at minimum the home page with all the children pages. Have some funcationality to return to the home page, and maybe include links to "other recipes" at the bottom of each recipe page.
4) Include linking images.
5) Create lists (ordered and unordered for ingedients/cooking procedures).
6) Practice basic HTML formatting.
