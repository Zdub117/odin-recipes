        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp salt</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa of your choice</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat over to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rinse the potatoes in water and cut them into quarter inch cubes.</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and 1 Tbsp of oil into the bowl. Toss until the potatoes are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Coat a baking sheet with the final 1 Tbsp of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Spread the potatoes out evenly onto the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes into the oven for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roughly 10 minutes before the potatoes are completed crack all 6 eggs into a large bowl. Gently wisk the eggs, and if desired add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place a skillet onto the stove and set it to medium heat. Place the butter into the skillet to melt.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted pour in the wisked eggs. Gently move the eggs around the skillet with a spatalu/turner cooking until mostly solid but soft and glistening. At this point add in the cheese and allow the cheese to melt into the eggs.</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs from the skillet and place into a large bowl. The potatoes, now cooked, should be added to the bowl as well. Gently toss the bowl to evenly distribute the potatoes and cheesy eggs.</li>
            <li>Split into 4 even bowls. Serve warm and topped with salsa.</li>
        </ol>
